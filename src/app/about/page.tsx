		<p>This is the question of the century. It makes my skin crawl trying
		to answer this question. I've written maybe 12 different editions
		of my "about page" and I don't like any of them. Describing myself 
		feels like bashing my head against a wall. It feels like having to 
		interview for a job that doesn't even pay well. It feels like rehersing a 
		60 second elevator pitch at the career fair. But thirteenth time's the 
		charm! Or whatever they say. </p>
	
		<p>My name is
		Ayah Almusaddy. I am 20 years old, attending college at UIC, majoring 
		in Computer Science and will be interning as a software engineer this 
		summer. I enjoy reading various genres, mainly fiction, occassionally 
		nonfiction if I'm feeling intelligent. I eat out a lot, walk around 
		downtown Chicago, go on runs, hang out with people, and contemplate 
		life's mysticism.</p>

		<p>I enjoy talking to people, listening to music, studying human
		related topics (like psychology or politics), sleeping 9 hours a night,
		and doing things that scare me. I romanticise life, people say I 
		have way too much confidence, and my face is already developing smile wrinkles.
		Life is beautiful and I am determined to enjoy every part of it.
		How you perceive me is up to you but I hope you enjoy the way
		my brain works as you read some of the things I've written.</p>

		<p>Honestly I don't know yet. I was going to use this website as a 
		way to write new pieces and experiment with different writing forms
		and styles. I plan on writing book reviews, thought pieces, essays,
		maybe some creative writing, and whatever else sounds fun and appealing.
		I will try to write a new piece every week but I doubt I'll be that
		consistent. I do not plan on monetizing this website so enjoy browsing
		without getting bombarded with ads! </p>
