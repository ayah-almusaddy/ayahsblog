          these are various pieces of writing i've done. currently, there's 
          not much here, but i plan on writing about everything â€” journal 
          entries, creative writing, book reviews, research papers, and 
          whatever else i want to experiment with. i'm not an expert writer 
          (far from it, actually), but I am tenacious and stubborn and will
          learn the skill of the pen. Or more accurately - the keyboard.
