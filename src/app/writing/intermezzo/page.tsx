                <ul className="list-disc pl-3 space-y-2">
                    <li>Peter, sickened with grief and drowning in self-hatred, goes back over and over again to Naomi and Sylvia, drunk with any love he can get from them. It’s a way for him to survive, gathering as much love as he can get because he has no other form of feeling worth within himself. </li>
                    <li>Peter’s struggle with depression, grief, drugs, and suicidal ideation influenced all his decisions and coping mechanisms from those decisions</li>
                    <li>The way Rooney wrote about Peter’s depression was very realistic, hard for me not to empathize with Peter because of it</li>
                    <li>I really wish we had a whole two other books written from the perspectives of Sylvia and Naomi</li>
                    <li>Peter and Sylvia were together, Sylvia got into an accident that left her irreparably damaged, they broke up, they still enjoy each other’s company as friends (not sexually bc Sylvia can’t with her disability, I think?), Peter still loves her</li>
                    <li>I don’t think Peter loved Naomi; I think he loved what she represented to him (hope and joy and the longing of youth)</li>
                    <li>His desire to be loved by Ivan and for them to have a relationship was genuinely the most painful part</li>
                    <li>Ivan desires human connection but struggles to figure out how to act like a normal human</li>
                    <li>Ivan has a very logical mind; he has a framework of how to perceive and look at the world, and sometimes I felt like he got stuck in this framework and couldn’t comprehend more nuance when perceiving people, especially Peter</li>
                    <li>Margaret struggles with morality; she’s constructed herself and her life before Ivan as this morally strong woman, a victim in her previous relationship with her abusive husband. She struggles with feeling like she’s sinning when with Ivan bc he’s so much younger than her. It places her in a position of power she has avoided in her life; to wield the ability to do wrong frightens her</li>
                    <li>There was a segment where Margaret explored her thoughts on her and her mother’s relationship and on motherhood itself. It was very fascinating and made me reconsider how I see her as a character.</li>
                    <li>I liked Margaret’s ability to understand human behavior; she was very psychologically intelligent, and it meshed well with Ivan’s logical intelligence</li>
                    <li>Overall, I just wish we got more of Ivan and Peter’s dynamic together. They met up once, Ivan blocked him after they fought, met up by accident at their family’s house, got into another argument, Peter punched Ivan, met up at Ivan’s tournament, where they finally reconciled. I would’ve loved more conversations with them together, or even if the people in their lives interacted more often.</li>
                    <li>Peter is generally supposed to be more unlikable, but I would argue that both Peter and Ivan have the same level of flaws and unlikability.</li>
                    <li>One of the largest themes in this book was selfishness. The desires of human beings to crave love and pleasure, and the struggle with how that desire makes them perceive themselves. </li>
                    <li>The writing style was my favorite part; it felt like reading their stream of consciousness. I don’t know if I’ve ever read a book that has so well written what the living human experience is like in someone’s mind</li>
                </ul>

                        <li>“Despised, they both were, of course. In love with one another and themselves.” pg 10</li>
                        <li>“The will to live so much stronger than anyone imagines.” pg 11</li>
                        <li>“Most women ultimately very likable individuals. Men, as everyone knows, disgusting.” pg 12</li>
                        <li>“Had believed once that life must lead to something, all the unresolved conflicts and questions leading one towards some great culmination… Irrational attachment to meaning. … Couldn’t go to work in the morning if he didn’t think something meant something meant something else. But what is it all leading up to. An end without an ending. … Under what conditions is life endurable?” pg 14</li>
                        <li>“Thoughts rattling and noisy almost always and then when quiet frighteningly unhappy. Mentally not right maybe. Never maybe was.” pg 16 </li>
                        <li>“Oh you take conversation too seriously, she says. Life isn’t just talking you know.” pg 16</li>
                        <li>“Consoling in its own way. Everything about her nearness is. And why. … Comfort of long companionship then. Opens up space and quiet for him to feel at last how tired he is, how depressed.” pg 17</li>
                        <li> “All quiet and stillness gathered at the point of her merciful touch. … Under these conditions, is life endurable. She understands and knows everything.” pg 19</li>
                        <li>“Money overall a very exploitative substance, creating it seems fresh kinds of exploitation in every form of relationality through which it passes. Greasing with exploitation the wheels of human interaction generally.” pg 67 </li>
                        <li>“Death of his own illusions: desire to fight for something, all his sacred rage directed and useful for once.” pg 68</li>
                        <li>“The meaningless lives people live. And afterwards, oblivion, forever. Futile rage at nothing. Directed one way or another, what’s the difference.” pg 69</li>
                        <li>“I wish I was dead. … And why not. Why doesn’t he, that is, if the idea is so consoling. Oh, for other people, of course: to protect them. Other people prefer you to suffer.” pg 69</li>
                        <li>“To be in the presence of her intellect: lifted into finer air. Still feels that way. Admires her in that way still, beauty of her mind. … For her, wanting her approval.  … To earn her respect. All the good in him, what little there is. Trying to be loved by her. His morality. Principle of his life.” pg 79</li>
                        <li>“Terror of solitude.” pg 79</li>
                        <li>“Exhausted, drunk, ashamed. Wanting forgiveness. Take back everything. Live the right life.” pg 80</li>
                        <li>“Nights he no longer has to spend trapped in claustrophobic solitude, self-medicated, panic attack or am I dying how to tell.” pg 127</li>
                        <li>“Why are they even annoyed with one another, he hardly remembers, or wants to. For the best, he thinks. Let her come crawling. The usual game, not to break first.” pg 127 (sylvia)</li>
                        <li>“She allows her tone to rise, high and tensed. I don’t even know what you want, she says. Whatever I do, it’s not enough. It has to be the one thing I can’t do, suddenly that’s the only thing you want. It’s like you’re trying to make me suffer, just because you’re suffering. … Crying she said to him: I want you to remember me. Too painful to contemplate. Staring into the sun somehow: agony intense enough to annihilate.” pg 136-137 (sylvia)</li>
                        <li>“Alone again in the claustrophobic silence of his failures. … Or just self-sabotage. His life in danger of becoming tolerable for a minute, why not go out of his way to aggrieve and distress the only person who could put up with him.” pg 137</li>
                        <li>“Her irrepressible love of life, he thinks. Pulling fried chicken apart with oily fingers. Last sip of soft drink rattling in the straw. Or trying on a new dress, the way her body luxuriates in tactility. Pleasure of her own gorgeousness in the mirror. Deep complete joy she finds in being alive. No job, no family support, no fixed address, no state entitlements, no money to finish college. Owner of nothing in the world but her own perfect body.” pg 151 (naomi)</li>
                        <li>“He doesn’t want after all for others to be poor, doesn’t even want to be rich. No. He only wants what he has always wanted: to be right, to be once and for all proven right.” pg 209</li>
                        <li>“Sometimes wonders how much of his capacity for pleasure is just vanity.” pg 220</li>
                        <li>“What does it mean? Desire by its nature resisting reason. The will to survive, appetite for life itself. These days, yesterday, last night, this morning. I’ve wanted everything.” pg 222</li>
                        <li>“The same ritual he thinks each time. She tries to extract from him some valuably hurtful information and he tries to conceal from her any aspect of his life in which he suspects she might gain a foothold. … Contest for dominance. Story of his life.” pg 234 (abt christine - his stepmom)</li>
                        <li>“Acceptance in their nature; yes, mute bewildered acceptance of life’s inexplicable cruelties.” pg 239</li>
                        <li>“What does he have to tell him anyway. I just want to say, I’m on your side. I know I’ve never done anything to help you, Ivan, but in principle, in spirit. I’ve been on your side all along.” pg 239</li>
                        <li>“How capable he has been of holding in his mind wth no apparent struggle such contradictory beliefs and feelings. The false true lover, the cynical idealist, the atheist at his prayers. Everything lethally intermixed, everything breaching its boundaries, nothing staying in its right place.” pg 293-294</li>
                        <li>“Why then this feeling, claustrophobic, panic even, as if concealing on his person a murder weapon. Because he has given each woman reason to believe that he is actually in love with her.” pg 314</li>
                        <li>“No, he thinks, no, no: the only question is how to choose. Should he take the cash prize or the new car, … Pitting one philosophy against another. Maturity against youth. Yes, sobriety against decadence, intellect against appetite” pg 316</li>
                        <li>“And it’s not so much the tangled relations, but the desire for some transparency in one’s personal life that is after all perverse.” pg 317</li>
                        <li>“Attachment, the cause of all suffering, so the Buddhists say. To cling to what you have, what you have had, the life you have known, the handful of people and places you have ever really loved, to cling and not let go.” pg 317</li>
                        <li>“Sickened with shame. To find his father reduced in the end to a figure of pity.” pg 321</li>
                        <li>“To inflict pain knowingly on others he has always been too cowardly: though he has, for all that, inflicted probably more than his fair share of pain.” pg 324</li>
                        <li>“Holding hard, harder, clutching, not letting go. Well, if that’s suffering, he thinks, let me suffer. Yes. To love whoever I have left. And if ever I lose someone, let me descend into a futile and prolonged rage, yes, despair, wanting to break things, furniture, appliances, wanting to get into fights, to scream, to walk in front of a bus, yes. Let me suffer, please. To love just these few people, to know myself capable of that, I would suffer every day of my life.” pg 325</li>
                        <li>“Final move she had to play he thinks. Or perhaps just wanted to. Why always assign to her the ulterior motive: let himself off the hook as usual.” pg 330</li>
                        <li>“Naomi crying over him, yes. Final gruesome victory in a game he should never have played. What he wanted after all, to defeat her, ruin her life. In retaliation for what, making a fool of him. Making him like her so much.” pg 358</li>
                        <li>“And what about God. Well, what about him. Feels the old kick of his spirit to think. Nothing can force me to endure what I hate, compel me to suffer, to accept suffering, indignity, nothing, no one, not even God. Just try and you’ll see. I won’t take it. You can’t make me.” pg 367</li>
                        <li>“Regrets that now, of course he regrets. It was different, it was more complicated. Difficult feelings, everyone was doing their best. He was a good person, he tried. No one is perfect. Sometimes you need people to be perfect and they can’t be and you hate them forever for not being even though it isn’t their fault and it’s not yours either. You just needed something they didn’t have in them to give you. And then in other people’s lives you do the same thing, you’re the person who lets everyone down, who fails to make anything better, and you hate yourself so much you wish you were dead.” pg 378-379 (after peter hits ivan and talks badly abt their father)</li>
                        <li>“She offered him friendship, a kind of friendship, yes, but he needed more. Or perhaps she offered him more, screened behind a veil of friendship, and he tore at that veil, foolishly, frantically, believing he could get to her.” pg 410</li>
                        <li>“Discovering instead with horror that his desires even when instantly and gorgeously gratified only make him increasingly unhappy and insane. Wanting too much. To love, to be loved.” pg 411</li>
                        <li>“I’m sorry. Everybody I love has to suffer. There’s something wrong with me. I don’t know how. I don’t know how to live.” pg 411-412</li>
                        <li>“I would like he thinks to live in such a way that I could vanish into think air at any time without affecting anyone and in fact I feel that for me this would constitute the perfect and perhaps the only acceptable life. At the same time I want desperately to be loved.” pg 417</li>
                        <li>“God’s humble and grateful servant. Can he imagine anything less like himself? And yet here he is, defeated, relieved, forgiving everything, praying only to be forgiven.” pg 427</li>
                        <li>“Yes, what the two of them have in common after all, impatient, ambitious, hard on other people, hard also on themselves.” pg 435</li>
                        <li>“To care so much. Grief does that.” pg 447</li>

                        Quotes from Ivan's perspective

                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
                        <li>“But a person’s outward appearance does not define the boundaries of their internal feelings.” pg 25</li>
                        <li>“People get to know each other, things happen, that’s life. The question for Ivan is how to become one of those people, how to live that kind of life.” pg 26</li>
                        <li>“The physical anxiety that accompanies chess events - exhibition games, tournaments - does not bear any meaningful relationship to the events themselves, except a chronological one: it arises beforehand and goes away afterwards. His mind knows this, but his body does not.” pg 25-26</li>
                        <li>“Just compare the two: the human mind weightless, abstract, capable of supreme rationality; the human body heavy, depressingly specific, making no sense at all. It just does things: no one knows why.” pg 27</li>
                        <li>“but at least the mind responds to reason. Sentience, he thinks. The body is an insentient object, animated by a sentience it does not share, like an insentient car is animated by a sentient driver.” pg 27</li>
                        <li>“Peter is the kind of person who goes along the surface of life very smoothly.” pg 28</li>
                        <li>“The human mind, for all the credit he was just giving it a minute ago, is often repetitive, often trapped in a familiar cycle of unproductive thoughts, which in Ivan’s case are usually regretful in nature.” pg 28</li>
                        <li>“How often in his life he has found himself a frustrated observer of apparently impenetrable systems, watching other people participate effortlessly in structures he can find no way to enter or even understand.” pg 89</li>
                        <li>“He feels himself to have been formed, somehow, with something other than life in mind.” pg 89</li>
                        <li>“For Peter, social systems are never confusing, always transparent, and usually manipulable to his own ends.” pg 89</li>
                        <li>“… due to his insectile physique.” pg 90 LOLLLL</li>
                        <li>“And for this, he thinks, whatever: despair, heartbreak, even losing his mind and going insane later on, anything. Literally, anything, any price. Yeah, he says. I think it’s a good idea. I do.” pg 99 (the cost of love)</li>
                        <li>“Nothing he has done or felt in this regard before has prepared him remotely for this new experience, with Margaret: the experience of mutual desire. To feel an interpenetration of thought between the two of them, understanding her, looking at her and knowing, yes, without even speaking, what she feels and wants, and knowing that she understands him also, completely.” pg 115</li>
                        <li>“But I’m very happy that I met you. And even knowing that you’re alive. I feel like my life will be a lot better. Just being able to remember - being with you, and having such a nice experience together.” pg 118 (so real, this is exactly what's going through my head when I'm with ppl I love)</li>
                        <li>“Whatever complicated circumstances may account for the situation, there is still this ultimate reality, that they are two people, a man and a woman, and the woman wants to lie in the arms of the man when she’s upset. And that reality has its own meaning.” pg 119</li>
                        <li>“Nonetheless, it is better to feel hopeful and optimistic about one’s life on earth while engaged in the never-ending struggle to pay rent, than to feel despondent and depressed while engaged in the same non-optional struggle anyway.” pg 158</li>
                        <li>“And what it says, Ivan thinks, is that Peter likes people he can dominate and feel superior to, and he’s not such a great fan of people who talk back to him and disagree.” pg 164</li>
                        <li>“The whole thing, taking Ivan out for dinner, being tactful, making sure he’s not in need of money: this is Peter’s way of trying to be a nice person, a good brother. Ivan finds this so touching that it’s actually sad, a sadness that seems to be related fundamentally to his brother’s personality.” pg 166-167</li>
                        <li>“His resolution never to see his brother again is, he thinks, a paltry solace for the consciousness of his own wrong.” pg 173 (ivan lacks emotional maturity)</li>
                        <li>“In nature, he thinks, there is no such thing as ugliness. It’s like he tried to tell Margaret in the car, beauty belongs to God, and ugliness to human beings, although he couldn’t explain himself very well.” pg 199</li>
                        <li>“But rather than smiling this time he felt a kind of acute feeling, almost like pain, opening out inside himself, and his eyes were stinging. To love, and for his love to be accepted, yes. It was in fact painful, the relief of all that compression suddenly, to say the words aloud, and hear her saying them, to be loved by her, it was so needed that it actually hurt.” pg 260</li>
                        <li>“Language doesn’t fit onto reality like a toy fitting into a slot. Reality is actually one thing and language is something else. You just have to agree with yourself not to think about it too much.” pg 263</li>
                        <li>“Life itself, he thinks, every moment of life, is as precious and beautiful as any game of chess ever played, if only you know how to live.” pg 267</li>
                        <li>“Yes, the world makes room for goodness and decency, he thinks: and the task of life is to show goodness to others, not to complain about their failings.” pg 275</li>
                        <li>“Yes, because he thought of death as an event, something that would happen and then be over. And indeed, when it came to be over, there was relief, there was a certain freedom with that, to be free of the anxiety of waiting. In the months since, Ivan has embraced this sense of freedom, he can see that now. He has made impulsive decisions, he has fallen in love, his life has been transformed, in an uncontrolled rush of energy and feeling. To live, he has needed to live, to overcome the terrible event, yes it was needed.” pg 388</li>
                        <li>“Because a living person has their own reality … The person who’s gone has no reality anymore, except in thoughts. … If I don’t think about him, literally, I’m ending his existence.” pg 392</li>

                        <li>“Margaret feels suddenly very kindly towards him, a rush of kindly feeling, to see him look so proud of himself.” pg 34</li>
                        <li>“She starts laughing then, and he smiles along with her, which she finds sweet: his unfeigned pleasure at being funny.” pg 37</li>
                        <li>“Why did she say the word ‘passionate’ to him when they were talking? And why did he repeat it so many times, three or even four times? Is the word ‘passionate’, or is it not, basically an obscene item of vocabulary? … A word with blood running through it, a red word. In casual conversation it’s better to use words that are grey or beige.” pg 39</li>
                        <li>“Looking at her, his eyes communicate: I know that you are a person with desires, and so am I, even if I am helpless to do anything about this knowledge.” pg 39</li>
                        <li>“And what if life is just a collection of essentially unrelated experiences? Why does one thing have to follow meaningfully from another?” pg 49</li>
                        <li>“She has been contained before, contained and directed, by the trappings of ordinary life. Now she no longer feels contained or directed by these forces, no longer directed by anything at all. Life has slipped free of its netting.” pg 57-58</li>
                        <li>“Margaret looking at her own life sees only the inwardly flowing blur of all experience.” pg 85</li>
                        <li>“the ultimately inconsequential expense of this dishwasher: evidence of Margaret’s essentially dutiful personality, her reliably self-sacrificing fulfillment of filial obligations.” pg 88</li>
                        <li>“Which she, too, believed in once: her own decently, a rag to clutch at, amid the squalor of their life.” pg 100</li>
                        <li>“It is wrong to be vain: obscurely, warming her hands over the air vent, Margaret knows and admits to herself that it is wrong. But wrong in what way? Who is the victim of the wrongness: just herself? Or somehow, other people?” pg 101</li>
                        <li>“She could perceive then that along with his painful feelings of disillusionment, he still felt, maybe even unconsciously, an almost childlike enthusiasm for the game of chess, both at the same time.” pg 120</li>
                        <li>“To reconstruct her life for him, the story of her life, her personality, to make herself interesting to him, to become in the process interesting even to herself.” pg 245</li>
                        <li>“To exercise once again, for a little time, who knows how long, the power to charm and fascinate, to be the object of an intense and searching desire. And to feel inside herself the reciprocating force of desire, this is what she gets, a life of her own.” pg 249</li>
                        <li>“Wishing irrationally that Ivan might try, despite all his brother’s faults, to care for him more. He, the older, disappointed, compromised person, who has made a mess of everything, who does not deserve Ivan’s love.” pg 258 (margaret identifies with this)</li>
                        <li>“a siege mentality; and at times, their family dynamic resembled nothing so much as an all-out-tug-of-war for her attention, children imploring, mother withholding.” pg 300</li>
                        <li>“Can the deep childhood impulse to trust one’s mother, to agree with her against oneself, ever be wrestled down by the comparatively thin force of reasoned argument? Are there even reasoned arguments to be made in matters of love, marriage, intimate life?” pg 302</li>
                        <li>“The demands of other people do not dissolve; they only multiply. More and more complex, more difficult. Which is another way, she thinks, of saying: more life, more and more life.” pg 312</li>
                        <li>“She did spend years giving out, acting the part of the long-suffering wife, the persecuted saint. Years of her life. Forced now to confess herself after all another humble sinner. Motivated not by consciousness but by her own selfishness: and the worst, most vulgar form of selfishness at that, which is desire.” pg 395</li>
                        <li>“It was weak people who needed compassion, weak men especially, like Ricky, the unfortunate soul. Margaret was strong, everyone always said so, a fine strong woman. For that alone, how many people hated her. And would relish her humiliation now at last it had come.” pg 396</li>
                        <li>“Deep down, Ivan had probably come to hate her, she thought: and she could even sense in herself the potential to hate him, for the selfishness he had brought out in her, for the life of decency he had interrupted.” pg 400</li>
